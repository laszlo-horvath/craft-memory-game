# Pawsome Pairs &#128062;

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

I've built a simple web application using React, Typescript and Redux that is a classic matching memory game using pictures of dogs.

The game has the following features:
- Supports 1 or 2 players
- In singleplayer mode, the game counts how many times the players uncovered 2 cards (trying to find 2 matches) and tracks his best (lowest) attempt
- In 2-player mode, the game counts how many times each player found a pair
- In 2-player mode, the players play in a hot-seat game, meaning they can uncover cards until they find matches, once no match, its the other players turn
- In 2-player mode the UI colors are changing according to the current player who turn is actual
- Supports sound effects
- Ability to disable/enable sounds effects
- Fully responsive UI supporting smaller screen sizes as well as mobile devices
- Cross-browser compatible (tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Commands
